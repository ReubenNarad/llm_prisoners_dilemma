So far, we've only cooperated, but if we defect only once, we could gain a larger immediate reward (5 instead of 3) and then go back to cooperating, and the bot would just continue to mirror our previous moves. This way, we could exploit the predictability of the bot and increase our long term reward."}, {"round": 2, "decision": "D", "reasoning": "The opponent's algorithm is conditional: if my last move was D, their next move will be D as well. However, given that their last move was C and they're \"reacting\" to my last move, they will defect this round. I should hence Defect (D) since it will yield a higher reward in this scenario (1 instead of 0 if I were to cooperate)."}, {"round": 3, "decision": "D", "reasoning": "The opponent's strategy is to begin with cooperation (C), and then mimic the previous move of the opponent. Knowing this, we can predict that following a round where we defect (D), the opponent will also defect (D). Therefore, since we defected in the last round and the opponent defected as well, we assume that the opponent will also defect in this round due to the reaction to our previous move. In this scenario, the best strategy is to also defect (D) to receive a pay-off of 1, rather than cooperating and receiving 0."}, {"round": 4, "decision": "D", "reasoning": "The opponent's strategy is to cooperate on the first move and then mimic the player's last move for all subsequent moves.

We have been continuously defecting and the opponent is also responding with deflection.

After the initial round of cooperation, the Python agent will cooperate if the opponent cooperated in the last round and defect if the opponent defected. Since my last move was defecting (D), the opponent will also defect in this round. Therefore, to maximise my reward in this round, I should continue to defect. When both players defect, each will receive 1 point, which is better than cooperating and receiving zero points because the opponent will definitely defect. There is no advantage to switching to cooperation in this case, as it will result in a loss. Hence, the best move is to continue to defect this round."}]
