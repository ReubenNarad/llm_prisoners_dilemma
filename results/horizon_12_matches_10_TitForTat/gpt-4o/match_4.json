[{"round": 0, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "The opponent's strategy is a simple Tit for Tat, starting with cooperation and mimicking your last move.

This helps me explore the opponent's behavior while potentially setting up a long-term strategy that leverages cooperation for the remainder of the game."}, {"round": 2, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Since the opponent's strategy is to cooperate unless you defect, cooperating now will encourage mutual cooperation, leading to higher long-term rewards."}, {"round": 3, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Reasoning: The opponent agent follows a strategy where it cooperates if you cooperated in the last round and defects if you defected. By cooperating now, I can aim to re-establish mutual cooperation, which will yield higher long-term rewards compared to consistent defection. In this repeated game, cooperation will maximize the long-term payoff."}, {"round": 4, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "The opponent's strategy is based on playing \"tit for tat,\" meaning it mirrors your previous move. To maximize long-term rewards, cooperating (C) will foster mutual cooperation, leading to a higher cumulative reward."}, {"round": 5, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Given the opponent's strategy, which is to cooperate unless you defect, maintaining cooperation will ensure mutual rewards of 3 while defecting will lead to a less optimal long-term outcome due to retaliation."}, {"round": 6, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Given that the opponent's strategy is to cooperate unless I defect, the most consistent way to maximize my long-term reward is to continue cooperating.

Since both players receive higher payoffs when they cooperate, maintaining cooperation will maximize your long-term reward."}, {"round": 9, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Given the opponent's strategy, which switches to defection in response to a defection and otherwise cooperates, the long-term reward is maximized by maintaining cooperation. Previous rounds of cooperation have resulted in consistent rewards of 3, while defects have led to lower total payoffs when the opponent switches to defection."}, {"round": 10, "decision": "D", "reasoning": "Reasoning: Given that the opponent's strategy is always to mirror your last move unless it is the first round, defecting (D) this round will result in the maximum immediate reward of 5. This is a form of exploration to test if you can get higher rewards without significantly compromising the long-term cooperation. The opponent will respond by defecting in the next round, allowing you to return to cooperation if needed. However, considering the game ends in two rounds, achieving a higher immediate payoff now may be beneficial."}, {"round": 11, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Based on the opponent's strategy, they will defect only if I defect.
