[{"round": 0, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Given the opponent's strategy, which cooperates unless defected against in the previous move, it's best to cooperate initially. This encourages mutual cooperation, yielding a higher long-term reward compared to defecting and risking a retaliation strategy. Exploring C early maximizes the potential for higher cumulative payoffs over the 12 rounds."}, {"round": 1, "decision": "D", "reasoning": "Defecting allows you to explore the opponent's response. Since their strategy is to defect if you defect, you can gauge their behavior based on your defection, which might inform your strategy for future rounds."}, {"round": 2, "decision": "D", "reasoning": "Since the opponent's strategy is to mimic your last move, by defecting this round, you maximize your reward to 5 this round, setting up a predictable D-D scenario for the remaining rounds where both players receive 1 each."}, {"round": 3, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "If I choose to cooperate (C), my opponent, following the provided strategy, will also cooperate in the subsequent rounds. This maximizes the potential for mutual cooperation and therefore a higher cumulative reward over the remaining rounds compared to consistent defections. Given my knowledge of the opponent's strategy, cooperating will yield a more favorable long-term outcome."}, {"round": 4, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "The opponent's strategy is to retaliate with defection if I defect. Cooperating maximizes long-term rewards by encouraging mutual cooperation in future rounds."}, {"round": 5, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "The opponent reacts by defecting if I defected in the previous move, but will otherwise cooperate. To maximize long-term rewards, I should aim to sustain cooperation."}, {"round": 6, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Given your goal to maximize long-term reward and your opponent's strategy of mirroring your previous move, cooperating (C) will maintain mutual cooperation, resulting in consistent high rewards (3 each round) for both players. Disconnecting disrupts this cycle and reduces potential total gains."}, {"round": 7, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Given that your opponent's strategy is to cooperate as long as you cooperate, defecting would trigger your opponent to defect in the next round, resulting in lower long-term rewards for both of you. To maximize your long-term reward, it is better to cooperate and keep the mutual cooperation going."}, {"round": 8, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Given the opponent's strategy to retaliate with defection only if the last action was a defection, it's more beneficial to maintain mutual cooperation for higher long-term rewards. Defecting would immediately jeopardize this cooperation."}, {"round": 9, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Continuing to cooperate will maintain mutual cooperation, resulting in steady rewards of 3. Defecting (D) would break the cycle and lead the opponent to defect as well, reducing future rewards. Thus, cooperation maximizes long-term gains."}, {"round": 10, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Given the opponent's strategy to retaliate with D if you defect, cooperating (C) maximizes long-term rewards by ensuring both players consistently receive 3 points per round. Defecting (D) would result in lower overall rewards and trigger a series of retaliations."}, {"round": 11, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Based on the opponent's strategy, defecting (D) now would cause the opponent to defect in the final round, resulting in both players receiving only 1 point each in the next round. By cooperating (C), I maintain mutual cooperation and continue receiving 3 points both this round and the next, maximizing the long-term reward."}]
