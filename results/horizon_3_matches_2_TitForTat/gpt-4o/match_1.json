[{"round": 0, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Reasoning: Your opponent follows a Tit-for-Tat strategy, which means they will cooperate if you cooperate and defect if you defect. By cooperating initially, you encourage mutual cooperation, which maximizes long-term rewards (3 points per round) compared to mutual defection (1 point per round)."}, {"round": 1, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Given the opponent's strategy, defecting will result in a response of D from the opponent in subsequent rounds.
