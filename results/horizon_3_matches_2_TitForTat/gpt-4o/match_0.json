[{"round": 0, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "The opponent's strategy cooperates as long as their opponent cooperates. By cooperating this round, you ensure the opponent continues to cooperate, leading to higher long-term rewards through mutual cooperation (both receiving 3 points each round)."}, {"round": 1, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "The opponent is playing a Tit-for-Tat strategy, which means they will mirror your previous action. Since your goal is to maximize your long-term reward, continuing to cooperate (C) will maintain mutual cooperation and yield higher overall rewards (3 per round) compared to defecting (1 per round if both defect, or 5 only once followed by a switch to defection by the opponent)."}, {"round": 2, "decision": "D", "reasoning": "Defecting this round gives a higher immediate payoff (5) compared to cooperating (3), and since the game is repeated with a history-based strategy, this round's decision helps in exploring the opponent's behavior and maximizing long-term knowledge."}]
