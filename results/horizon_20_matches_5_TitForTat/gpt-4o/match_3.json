This could help to maximize the long-term reward by gauging how I can leverage their predictable strategy in the subsequent rounds."}, {"round": 2, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Given that the opponent's strategy is to mirror your last move, defecting (D) would cause the opponent to defect in the next round, leading to a continuous cycle of low rewards (1,1). Cooperating (C) this round ensures that the opponent will also cooperate in the following round, allowing both of us to consistently receive higher rewards (3,3) over the remaining rounds. This maximizes my long-term reward."}, {"round": 3, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "Since your opponent's strategy clearly indicates that they will cooperate unless you defect, maintaining cooperation (C) from this point will ensure higher consistent rewards (3 per round) rather than the 1 you would get from mutual defection (D).

By consistently cooperating, you ensure mutual cooperation and the optimal long-term reward of 3 per round."}, {"round": 8, "decision": "C", "reasoning": "The opponent's strategy is to cooperate unless they are defected against in the previous round.
